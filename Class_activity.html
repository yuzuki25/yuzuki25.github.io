    <p>Hi my name is Yuzuki Needham and I am 25 years old. Originally from Japan, I moved to Colorado at the age of 9, and have been here since. I've graduated CU Denver two years ago and have been working as a pizza chef since, but I've grown tired of working as one. So with this certification, I'm hoping it'll lead me to new doors and a better future.</p>
